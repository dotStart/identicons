Server Usage
------------

For simplicity this repository ships with a simple server application which exposes various 
endpoints for generating identicons without requiring you to embed the go library into your
application! Simply download a suitable executable from the 
[releases](https://github.com/dotstart/identicons/releases) section or use one of the 
[docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/dotstart/identicons):

```
# Native Installation
$ identicons serve -bind=127.0.0.1:8080

# Docker Installation
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 dotstart/identicons:0.1.0
```

The following endpoints are made available by the command:

 * **/random** - Displays a random image for each request
 * **/ip** - Displays an image for the client ip address
 * **/{input}** - Displays an image for an arbitrary input value

All endpoints are also made available for each of the supported generators. For instance, you may
retrieve a random image generated by the `block` generator via `/block/random`.

The following generator identifiers are currently allocated:

 * `block`
 * `circle`
 * `circle-matrix`
 * `classic`
 * `modern`

### Docker

The following tags are currently maintained in addition to the respective version number tags:

 * **latest** - Always points to the latest release (mirrors `master`)
 * **dev** - Bleeding edge release (mirrors `develop`)

A mirror of the Docker image is available via the GitHub package registry under the tag name 
`ghcr.io/dotstart/identicons`.

Library Usage
-------------

If you are developing a go application, you may alternatively embed the library and directly invoke
it where necessary. We currently provide two modes of operation:

Direct Call
-----------

```go
import (
  "github.com/dotstart/identicons/library/identicons/icon/block"
)

// choose a generator and customize its options
gen := block.New()

// Option #1 - Write directly to a file or stream
gen.Write([]byte("some awesome input value"), writer)

// Option #2 - Write to another SVG
gen.Write([]byte("some awesome input value"), canvas)
```

HTTP Handler Functions
----------------------

```go
import (
  identicons "github.com/dotstart/identicons/library/identicons/http"
  "github.com/dotstart/identicons/library/identicons/icon/modern"
)

gen := modern.New()

http.HandleFunc("/avatars", identicons.NewInputHandlerFunc(gen))
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```
